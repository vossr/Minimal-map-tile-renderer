map raster tile rendered  
holds state with quadtree  
exponential zoom  
vector tile renderers upload to vram with glBufferData() etc.  
it might be faster to render like i do here (html image elements),  
    instead of uploading gl texture like mapbox and maplibre  

<img src="i.png" width="500" height="auto"/>
